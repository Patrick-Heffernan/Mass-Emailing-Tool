# Mass-Emailing-Tool
If you ever need to send the same message to many people, but want to customize the message to include their name, this program is for you!

It pulls data from an excel spreadsheet, then translates it to a dictionary data type with the person's name as the key, and their email as the value. Next, the program sends a personal email, addressing the individual by name while sending the same message.
